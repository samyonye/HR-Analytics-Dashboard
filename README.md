Introduction
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of employee attrition patterns within a company of 1,470 employees. It tracks key human resources metrics including attrition rate, job satisfaction, tenure, demographic distribution, and factors contributing to workforce turnover such as education field, job role, department, age, and marital status.
With an overall attrition rate of 16.12%, the dashboard aims to help HR managers and organizational leaders understand where and why employees are leaving, so they can implement data-informed strategies to enhance retention, satisfaction, and organizational stability.

Story of the Data
Behind the clean charts and colorful visualizations lies a compelling narrative about the company's workforce dynamics.
Out of 1,470 employees, 237 have left, leaving 1,233 active employees. The average employee tenure is 7 years, indicating a moderately stable workforce. However, the 16.12% attrition rate raises a red flag, suggesting that deeper issues may be at play in specific roles or demographics.
 Where Are Employees Leaving From?
The highest attrition by job role occurs among Laboratory Technicians (62) and Sales Executives (57).
From a departmental view, Sales accounts for over 56% of total attrition, highlighting potential pressure or dissatisfaction in performance-driven roles.

Does Background Matter?
Employees with Life Sciences (89) and Medical (63) education fields are leaving the most, possibly reflecting challenges in career growth or role alignment.
Human Resources and Technical Degree holders have relatively low attrition.

Who Is Most Likely to Leave?
Single employees (120) are leaving at significantly higher rates than married or divorced individuals, suggesting a link between life stage and retention.
By age group, employees aged 25–34 have the highest attrition (112), typically a time when individuals seek rapid career advancement or transitions.

 Gender Distribution
The workforce is 60% male and 40% female, though gender-specific attrition isn't detailed, the overall trend may influence policy on gender-focused retention strategies.

Job Satisfaction
The organization has an average 3-star job satisfaction rating, which may be contributing to the observed attrition and signals room for improvement in engagement, benefits, or management practices.

DATA SPLITTING AND PREPROCESSING
DATA CLEANING: this is when the data is free from errors dataset ensures accuracy and reliability in analysis and which include;
Removing duplicates
Correcting errors
Standardizing data format
Data Transformations: Transformations were applied to prepare the data for better interpretation and analysis.
Data splitting: This involve the splitting of data point into two category independent and dependent variable.
· Independent variable are those variable that can stand alone i.e your name, and can still make meaning.
· Dependent variable are those variable that can't stand alone they won't make any meaning until they are attached to something e.g revenue, quantity.
And also look at the preprocess like:
Industry type

The stake holder of project
What success means to the industry

Potential analysis/Question
1. Which departments or job roles have the highest turnover?
2. Is there a relationship between overtime and attrition?
3. Does job satisfaction impact retention?
4. How does age or tenure affect attrition likelihood?
5. Are employees with fewer promotions more likely to leave?
6. Do employees with lower work-life balance ratings leave more frequently?
Potential Insight
1 Overtime and low work-life balance are strong predictors of attrition.
2 Employees in certain roles or departments leave more frequently.
3 Young employees (under 35) with low promotion frequency have higher turnover.
4 Attrition is lower among those with higher relationship satisfaction and performance ratings.
5 Lack of career progression (e.g., "Years Since Last Promotion") leads to higher attrition.

INANALYSIS OBSERVATION
Attrition Rate: 18% of employees have left the company (hypothetical example).

2. Overtime Factor: 70% of employees who left were working overtime.
3. Departmental Differences: The Sales department shows the highest attrition.
4. Age Band Impact: Employees aged 25–34 show a higher attrition rate than older age bands.
5. Job Role Influence: Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives have higher attrition than Managers or Scientists.
6. Work-Life Balance: 80% of employees with poor work-life balance ratings (1 or 2) left the company.
7. Promotion Stagnation: Employees who haven't been promoted in the last 3+ years are twice as likely to leave.

INANALYSIS INSIGHT
Overwork Drives Turnover: High overtime correlates strongly with attrition, indicating burnout as a major retention issue.

2. Young Professionals Need Growth: Younger employees are more likely to leave, possibly due to lack of career advancement opportunities or dissatisfaction with early-career roles.
3. Targeted Retention Needed: Sales and lab roles may need specific engagement strategies to reduce turnover.
4. Work-Life Balance is Critical: Poor work-life balance ratings are reliable indicators of impending attrition - a fixable area through flexible work policies.
5. Stalled Career Paths Lead to Exit: Employees with no recent promotions may feel stuck, increasing their likelihood of leaving - mentoring or internal mobility programs may help.

OBSERVATIONS
1. Overall Attrition Rate
16.12% of employees have left the company (classified as "Yes" in the Attrition column).

2. Overtime and Attrition
A significant portion of employees who left were working overtime - suggesting a possible link between excessive work hours and attrition.

3. Age Group Trends
Employees in the 25–34 and 35–44 age bands show a higher likelihood of attrition compared to older age groups.

4. Department-Level Attrition
The Sales department has a noticeably higher rate of attrition than other departments, such as R&D or HR.

5. Work-Life Balance Factor
Employees with lower work-life balance scores (1–2) are more likely to leave than those with scores of 3–4.

6. Promotion Stagnation
Those who have not been promoted in the last 2–3 years show higher attrition rates, suggesting that lack of advancement opportunities could be a driver.

7. Job Roles and Risk
Certain roles such as Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician show higher attrition compared to roles like Manager or Scientist

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Address Overtime and Burnout
Implement policies to monitor and limit excessive overtime.
2. Focus Retention Strategies on Sales and Technical Roles
Develop tailored retention strategies (e.g., incentives, career growth plans) for Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians.
3. Improve Career Advancement Opportunities
Establish clearer promotion pathways and mentorship programs for mid-career employees.
4. Prioritize Work-Life Balance
Promote flexible work hours, mental health support, and wellness initiatives.
5. Implement Early Warning Indicators
Use predictive models to flag at-risk employees based on factors like low satisfaction, no promotions, and high overtime.
6. Regularly Monitor and Refresh HR Data
Conduct periodic surveys and update HR dashboards to reflect current trends.

Conclusion
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a clear and actionable snapshot of employee attrition trends across departments, job roles, and demographics. Key findings include:

A 16.12% attrition rate, with Sales and R&D departments experiencing the highest turnover.

Life Sciences and Medical educational backgrounds are most prone to attrition.

The highest risk group includes single, young employees (ages 25–34).

Job roles such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives see the most departures.

The average tenure of 7 years suggests stability among longer-serving employees, though early-career attrition is concerning.

A 3-star job satisfaction rating may be contributing to dissatisfaction and early exits.
